                <h2>Restorative</h2>
                <p>In addition to creating connected communities, farmers markets have the potential to create happier communities as well. Dombrovski (2016) compares research done on the restorative nature of parks to farmer’s markets to see if there is a similar effect at a farmer’s market. She opens up the article with past research done into the restorative nature of parks on users who interact with those spaces. Afterwards, she then posits that a similar effect could be seen from a farmer’s market due to some similarities between the way the spaces are used. Dombrovski then presents the method and findings of her research. From several different sources, she collected data at two large farmer’s markets in the Sacramento area. She utilized a site analysis, a questionnaire, and an open ended response to create her data set. In her article, she lays out what was found with each piece of data collected. She compared the data collected from the farmers markets that she was observing to related restorative places such as parks. In comparison to parks, she found that farmer’s markets do show similar patterns of refreshment and seem to have the potential to be restorative places. As a result, farmers markets are areas communities can gather in and utilize and be restored, leading to a happier community.

                <h2>Connection</h2>
                <p>Furthermore, besides aiding in creating community and refreshing visitors, farmers markets have the potential to get resources to members of the community who are underserved, especially those in food deserts. Sadler (2016) examines the effects on the community of Flint, Michigan on a move of the farmer’s market from outside of the city to its heart. First, he establishes a background on the research done into accessibility of farmer’s markets to various demographics in less affluent areas. Then, he describes the food deserts and lack of access to nutritious food in Flint. From these things, the city of Flint made a move to bring the farmer’s market back into the city center to help close the gap. Sadler conducted several different large scale surveys before and after to see how the change in location created a change in the market’s customer base and if it helped mediate the food desert. His survey asked questions to find characteristics of customers at the market. Upon comparing the data from before the move to after, he found that a greater number of customers were coming from areas which were underserved by grocery and convenience stores. He posits that the move from a further location to a closer location to the underserved areas helped greatly in beginning to serve the areas that needed help. As a result of the move, members of the community had greater access to the fresh produce that they did not have great access to before.</p>

                <h2>Accessibility</h2>
                <p>In order for all of these to work, location is key. Shi and Hodges present their research into the usage of farmers markets and relative access to them. They posited that markets close to consumers and far from convenience stores see more customers than markets in the opposite context. In addition they hypothesized that perception played a big role in determining whether or not a customer goes to the market. To prove these, they sent out a survey by mail to randomly selected households in Florida asking for the main food shopper in the household to give feedback on several aspects of farmers markets. After receiving feedback from these households, they found that their hypotheses were true. Many people are more motivated to shop at farmers markets when they are closer to the market, have less options for other food, and have swaying perceptions of the food available at the market. As a result, access is key to getting people to the markets to participate in all they have to offer.</p>

                <h2>Community</h2>
                <p>To begin with, public spaces such as farmers markets are areas that foster community within larger cities where it can be hard to create a sense of community. Gehl (2009) examines the ways that public spaces have been used over time and and argues their importance to urban communities. He gave a comprehensive background on the existence of public spaces, like markets, in urban areas. Through the background Gehl gave, he explored the changing role and importance of public spaces for people living in urban areas through time, and how it affected the communities within the city. He shows that at the beginning of the twentieth century, public spaces were integral to the function of the city, and had three functions: meeting, market, and connection. At the turn of the century, the idea of public space began to change and it began to be seen in a negative light. Consequently, at the conclusion of the First and Second World Wars, public spaces were not as integral to urban areas due to popular suburban neighborhoods and a growing divide between city and suburbia. However, in the 1960s and 1970s, there was a major shift in Europe to reintroduce public space and create pedestrian streets. Gehl highlights the changes that the reintroduction of public space in the Netherlands made to the communities in the surrounding area. Many of these changes were positive not only for connecting people, but also for business and revenue. Activating public spaces in urban areas is a means of fostering community and creating connected cities.</p>
