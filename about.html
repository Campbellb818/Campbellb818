                <h1>a raleigh market</h1>
                <p>The North Carolina State Farmers Market is based in Raleigh in the downtown area. Just behind Dorothea Dix park, it is situated in an area of town that is easy to access. It is also situated in an area where a lot of 
growth is occurring.
It first opened in its current location in 1991 on an old dairy farm, but the history of a farmers market in Raleigh spans beyond the First World War. 
The current location allowed the mar-
ket to expand for more farmers to sell and allow easy access from I-40. It was built to create a space for farmers and customers to connect face to face.
The market is home to many farmers and has been for many years. Some farmers have been selling their produce at the market for over 25 years. They come from all around the state, from as far as just outside of Boone to as close as Zebulon. Most sell a great variety of in season fruit and vegetables.  
The market has been part of many of the localsâ€™ daily or weekly routine. 
There is group who comes regularly 
to buy produce from their favorite vendors. Furthermore, a large portion 
of the Raleigh population has been to the farmers market or knows about it. 
It is a Raleigh icon. </p>

                <h1>market space</h1>
                <p>The public area of the State Farmers Market consists of four main market areas: a general produce market, a wholesale produce market, a home goods market, and a general foods market. Surrounding these markets is fairly abundant parking and small pockets of green space. The general produce market is an open air market and is the largest of these areas. It features a good selection of fresh produce from many farmers around the state. The wholesale market has lots of fresh produce sold in bulk. The homegoods market is completely enclosed and features lots of vendors selling various goods from candles to artisan breads. The general foods market has similar goods to the homegoods market, but is an open air market.</p>
