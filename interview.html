                <p>The farmers market is going through a great period of change right now. The market is feeling the effects of other markets and the influx of new customers into the triangle.</p>

                <h2>Meet the Vendors</h2>
                <p>We interviewed two of the vendors at the State Farmers Market to see what it was like as a vendor at the market. They gave us some more insight into the space and what they do every day. We interviewed Cindy Lowe and Gene Lee, of Sugarloaf Orchards and R&D Produce, respectively. Read what they had to say down below.</p>

                <p>Can you tell us a little more about your farm, like where it’s located?</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
                <p>How long have you been selling at the Farmers’ Market?</p><br><br><br><br>
                <p>Have any other vendors been here that long?</p><br><br><br><br>
                <p>Since Raleigh has gotten a lot bigger in recent years, have you found that you have more buyers now than when you started selling here?</p><br><br><br><br><br><br>
                <p>Why might people be buying less?</p>

                <p>CL: We are located in the Brushy Mountains of North Carolina, which is near Boone, NC. We take 421-North out of Winston Salem and go through Yadkinville into Wilkes County--and as you get into Wilkes County, we take Hwy 16 North, and our packing house is on the right-hand side. The farm, or some of the land, is located behind the Apple House on top of the Brushy Mountains and down Mount Olive Church Road.</p><br>
                <p>GL: Our farm started in ‘75, and we’re still trying to hang on. We are from the Johnston County area.</p><br>
                <p>CL: We’ve been here for over 25 years. A long time!</p><br>
                <p>GL: We’ve been here for twelve years now.</p><br>
                <p>CL: Yes they have, most of those people on the far-left side have been here since the doors opened.</p><br>
                <p>GL: Yeah, I know everybody out here, everybody’s, you know, like a family.</p><br>
                <p>CL: No, we have a different clientele and times have changed where people are buying less in smaller packages. But they’re still coming and still buying. I think a lot of it is that there are a lot of smaller markets that have sprung up all over Raleigh, Holly Springs, Apex, Cary, and I think it’s just kinda split up the clientele to visit other places, but we still have a large crowd that comes here. And there’s room to grow, I believe we’re gonna grow.</p><br>
                <p>GL: Years ago it used to be busier. A lot of people nowadays, you know, everything is in season. Things like cabbage aren’t an everyday thing but it works out.</p><br>
                <p>CL: I think it’s just that they’re shopping at other farmers markets, and younger people are buying less but they’re still coming, and that’s what is important!</p><br>
                <p>GL: A lot of older generations are still coming. A lot of the newer customers don't can anymore, they don’t freeze, they buy what they need at the moment. But we still have old ones who buy in bulk and freeze and can.</p>
